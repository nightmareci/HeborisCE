bgm.txt - background music
--------------------------

This directory stores all the BGMs used in the game. If a BGM's file(s) are
missing, then that BGM will not be played. The supported formats are:

	.wav, .ogg, .mp3

Any mix of formats can be used, and the formats are tried in the order listed
above.

Looping BGMs support a "leadin" feature, where a leadin track is played first,
then the main part is looped without the leadin. A separate audio file is used
for the leadin, with the name of the looping main part with "_leadin" appended,
e.g. use both bgm_leadin.ogg and bgm.ogg for SIMPLE BGM. The leadin feature is
not supported for tracks that are not looping.

The following tracks are used in-game.
